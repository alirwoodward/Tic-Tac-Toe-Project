# Tic-Tac-Toe-Project

This final report for my programming languages college class acts as a functioning game of tic tac toe. The game was coded using both TypeScript and JavaScript to experiment with languages I did not have any prior experience in.

To run my project: download the finalProjectCode folder so that all 5 files are together

The TypeScript file game.ts can be compiled by simply running "tsc" in the command line

game.ts can be compiled to create the JavaScript file by running "tsc game.ts" in the command line

To open the game in a web browser, simply open the index.html file by clicking on it and you will be taken to the fully running program in your web browser

For a demo of my project's compiling, and execution, please visit the following video: https://youtu.be/yDoLiSOlFX0
